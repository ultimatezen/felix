way as in menu <u>Start</u> of Windows XP; And menu View to toggle<br>transparency of the window and menus.</font><br>

By using <b>VXPLib</b> you can easily create menus adherent to <b>Windows XP</b> menu interface.<br>
Such menus for the best appearance have a 48x48 icon in them with at least 256 color<br>
palette, the item name and explanation displayed using different fonts to distinguish<br>
the main informative part from additional information.<br>
Because we use <b>Quick HTML</b> for displaying such menus you can put your own imagination<br>
into how menus should look in your application. The main idea the author persuades here<br>
is the concept of organizing the user interface in the most beautiful and informative<br>
way. Additionally, tooltips were attached to each menu item to show how much information<br>
you can give to the user without having him to click on the menu item first.<br>
<u>Note</u>: In this example the author used the same contents for the tooltips as for the menu<br>
items just for simplicity to avoid writing separate QHTML documents. In your application<br>
you can put as much information in such tooltips as you want. And don't forget those tooltips<br>
also support <u>any speech platform</u> so you can turn designing menus in your application into
<br>an art.<br>

<font face='Times New Roman' size=12>Take a look at the code,
you will find it very simple and easy to understand.<br>
There are no fancy menu classes used for displaying those menu items,
they are drawn just<br>
by using COM interface <font color=darkblue weight=700>IVXPQuickHTML</font> drawing routines.
